1. Login to the FortiAP CLI
SSH into your FortiAP device:

ssh admin@<FortiAP_IP>
2. Enter Configuration Mode
Once logged in, enter configuration mode:

cfg -s
This will show the list of variables and their current values.

3. Configure the Port 2 as a LAN Port for Downlink
Now, configure Port 2 for LAN usage (downlink), which means it will handle client traffic.

Youâ€™ll first need to set FAP_ETHER_TRUNK to a suitable value (if applicable to your FortiAP model) to control the behavior of the Ethernet ports.

If your FortiAP has trunking options:
To use Port 2 in LAN mode (as a downlink port), you could do the following:

cfg -a FAP_ETHER_TRUNK=0
This will set Port 2 (or the second Ethernet port) as a dummy switch, meaning it will be used for general traffic and not as part of an aggregation or specialized behavior.

Ensure the AP is in the right mode
Verify the AP Mode setting to ensure it's configured as a Thin AP (AP_MODE=0):

cfg -a AP_MODE=0
4. Configure Mesh Settings
You can configure the mesh parameters to allow Port 2 to participate in the mesh network.

Enable Background Scanning for Mesh: You may want to enable background scanning for mesh network discovery:

cfg -a MESH_AP_BGSCAN=1
Set Mesh Backhaul Settings: If Port 2 is also meant to act as a mesh backhaul, configure mesh security and SSID:

cfg -a MESH_AP_SSID="fortinet.mesh.root"
cfg -a MESH_AP_SECURITY=1  # WPA2 Security
cfg -a MESH_AP_PASSWD="yourMeshPassword"
Set Mesh Communication Type: Set communication type for the mesh backhaul (Ethernet or Wi-Fi):

cfg -a MESH_AP_TYPE=0  # Ethernet (for wired backhaul)
Bridge Ethernet Port with Mesh WiFi (Optional): If you want to bridge the mesh backhaul to the Ethernet port (Port 2), use this:

cfg -a MESH_ETH_BRIDGE=1
5. Configure Port 2 Behavior for Downlink
To enable Port 2 to handle downlink traffic, use these commands:

cfg -a WANLAN_MODE="WAN-LAN"
This command configures Port 2 to bridge LAN and WAN (in the case of FortiAP models that support this configuration). If the FortiAP uses Port 2 to connect clients, it will forward traffic between the client and the mesh network.

6. Commit the Configuration
Once you have made these changes, commit them to the flash storage:

cfg -c
7. Verify the Configuration
You can verify that your configuration has been applied correctly by checking the mesh status and port behavior:

cw_diag -c mesh
cw_diag -c mesh-ap
cw_diag -c mesh-veth-acinfo
Also, verify the interface status for Port 2:

cfg -s
This will give you the updated status of Port 2 and its associated settings.
